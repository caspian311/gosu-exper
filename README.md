##GOSU Experimentations##

Just a learning space for me and my gosu experiments. All experiments will be located on their own branches.

###Experiments/Branches###
* **Bouncing ball** - my first attempt at an actual game!
* **Tutorial** - this is straight from [the ruby tutorial](https://github.com/gosu/gosu/wiki/Ruby-Tutorial). I know I didn't need to put it here but I did and it doesn't bother me so it shouldn't bother you.

###Setup###

    $ brew install sdl2
    $ bundle
    
###Running###

    $ ./go.sh
